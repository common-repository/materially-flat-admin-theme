== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin in any way influence my frontend? =

In a way yes, it just changes the look of your admin bar on the frontend when you are logged in.

= Does this plugin work if my wordpress file system is direct i.e my wordpress installation never asks for my ftp username and password before installing any plugin or theme =

Yes, you have access to all the features of this plugin.

= Does this plugin work if my wordpress works on ftp, i.e my wordpress installation always asks for my ftp username and password before installing any plugin or theme =

Yes and no, just the theme alone would work for both the admin and login page. Things like the font color, font style, link color etc would not work. Still working on that one. If you are okay with that, then good.
